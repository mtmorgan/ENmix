Description: Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip has a complex array design, and 
    the measurement is subject to experimental variations. The ENmix R package 
    provides tools for low level data preprocessing to improve data quality. It 
    incorporates a model based background correction method ENmix, and provides
    functions for inter-array quantile normalization, data quality checking,
    exploration of multimodally distributed CpGs and source of data variation.
    To support large scale data analysis, the package also provides 
    multi-processor parallel computing wrappers for some commonly used data 
    preprocessing methods, such as BMIQ probe design type bias correction and 
    ComBat batch effect correction.
