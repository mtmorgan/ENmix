Description: Illumina Methylation BeadChip array measurements have 
    intrinsic levels of background noise that degrade methylation measurement.
    The ENmix package provides an efficient data pre-processing tool designed 
    to reduce background noise and improve signal for DNA methylation estimation.
    Several efficient novel methods were incorporated in the package: ENmix is a
    model based background correction method that can significantly improve 
    accuracy and reproducibility of methylation  measures; RCP taking 
    advantage of the high spatial correlation of DNA methylation levels between 
    nearby type I and II probe pairs to reduce probe type bias and improve 
    data quality on type II probe measures.The data structure used by the 
    ENmix package is compatible with 
    several other related R packages, such as minfi, wateRmelon and ChAMP, 
    providing straightforward integration of ENmix-corrected datasets for 
    subsequent data analysis. The software is designed to support large 
    scale data analysis, and provides multi-processor parallel computing 
    wrappers for some commonly used but computation intensive data 
    preprocessing methods.
    In addition ENmix package has selectable complementary functions for 
    efficient data visualization (such as data distribution plotting), 
    quality control (identification and filtering of low quality data points, 
    samples, probes, and outliers, along with imputation of missing values), 
    inter-array normalization (3 different quantile normalizations), 
    identification of probes with multimodal distributions due to SNPs and 
    other factors, and exploration of data variance structure using principal 
    component regression analysis plots. Together these provide a set of 
    flexible and transparent tools for preprocessing of EWAS data in a 
    computationally-efficient and user-friendly package.
