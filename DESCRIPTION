Description: Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip has a complex array design, and
    the measurement is subject to experimental variations. The ENmix
    package provides tools to preprocess data from the array. It includes functions 
    to improve data quality and to prepare clean dataset for EWAS and other DNA methylation
    analyses. The ENmix uses the same data structure as R package minfi,
    and is compatible with several R packages, such as minfi and waterMelon, 
    and provides complementary functions for data quality control, background 
    correction, inter-array normalization and data confounder exploretion.
    Especially, the package incorporates a novel model based background correction
    method ENmix, which was demonstrated to outperform other alternative background 
    correction method. To support large scale data analysis, the package also provides 
    multi-processor parallel computing wrappers for some commonly used data 
    preprocessing methods, such as BMIQ probe design type bias correction and 
    ComBat batch effect correction.
