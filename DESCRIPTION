Description: The ENmix package provides a set of quality control and data 
    pre-processing tools for Illumina Methylaiton 
    HumanMethylation450 and MethylationEPIC Beadchips. 
    These functions can be used to remove unwanted experimental noise and thus to
    improve accuracy and reproducibility of methylation measures. 
    ENmix functions 
    are flexible and transparent. Users has option to use a single pipeline 
    command to finish all data pre-processing steps (including background correction, 
    dye-bias adjustment, inter-array normalization and probe-type bias correction) or 
    to use individual functions sequentially to perform data pre-processing in more 
    customized manner. In addition the \Rpackage{ENmix} package has selectable 
    complementary functions for efficient data visualization (such as data 
    distribution plotting); quality control (identification and filtering of 
    low quality data points, samples, probes, and outliers, along with 
    imputation of missing values); identification of probes with multimodal 
    distributions due to SNPs and other factors; exploration of data variance
    structure using principal component regression analysis plots and preparation
    of experimental factors related control variables to be adjusted in downstream 
    statistical analysis. The data structure used by the \Rpackage{ENmix} 
	package is compatible with several other related R packages, such as minfi,
    wateRmelon and ChAMP, providing straightforward integration of 
    ENmix-corrected datasets for subsequent data analysis. The software 
	is designed to support large scale data analysis, and provides
    multi-processor parallel computing options for most functions.
